Four Bristol researchers have been awarded UK Research and Innovation's (UKRI) prestigious Future Leaders Fellowships. Dr Anya Skatova, a Turing Fellow and behavioural scientist at Bristol Medical School: Population Health Sciences (PHS) will work on realising the value of transaction data to improve population health. Her fellowship will question whether shopping history data, such as recorded through supermarket loyalty cards, can be used in a positive way to support health research and the development of new interventions.
