Anya Skatova is Vice-Chancellor's Fellow in Digital Innovation and Wellbeing at the School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol. She gained her PhD in Psychology at the University of Nottingham, and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Nottingham and the University of Warwick. She has extensive network of industry contacts and always open for new collaborations. 

Currently Anya focuses on using large transactional (e.g., banking and retail) datasets to study individual difference in decision-making, wellbeing and personality. She is also working on linking banking and retail loyalty card datasets with data collected through longitudinal population studies (LPS) through joining behavioural patterns that can be learned from transactional data with rich medical, genetic, early life environment and other records collected by LPS. Finally, she works on a range of projects related to public attitudes to data sharing including whether individuals can assign value to their personal data and what are perceived risks and benefits of sharing personal data with various organisations.
